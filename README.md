# 🤖 Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Machine Learning Projects** repository!  
This repository is a curated collection of hands-on ML projects that demonstrate my understanding of data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, evaluation, and real-world problem solving.

Each project focuses on applying machine learning concepts to practical datasets and business-oriented problems.
